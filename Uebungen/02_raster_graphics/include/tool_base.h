Abstract tool.
This class provides the basic superclass for all tools (pen, lines, circle...)
The constructor of the class takes a reference of a canvas_buffer as parameter
on which the pixels are changed. 
The user of an instance of a derived class can use two different draw methods:
One version that operates only with the information of a single position
(e.g. the pen or the fill tools) and one that needs two pixel positions
(e.g. the line, circle or box). Also every tool maintains an element of
the enumerations of possible shapes (which are used for the preview tool).
For debugging purpose a method "set_text" is provided which modifies a
text stream that will be displayed in the main window.
